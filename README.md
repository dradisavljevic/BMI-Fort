# BMI fort

A simple fortran program that calculates BMI based on the height and weight you put in. Works with both imperial and metric system. Just be sure you put your height in centimeters and weight in kilograms for the metric system and in inches and pounds respectively for the imperial unit system.

Purpose of the project is to allow myself to calculate my BMI without having to go online, as well as something that will passively aggressively tell me I have let myself go (This may or may not be inspired by the fact I haven't really exercised in the past 2 weeks due to school obligations), while also being a nice opportunity to code something simple in Fortran.
